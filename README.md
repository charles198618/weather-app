# weather-app

## Description 

This is a  weather-app that I'm creating. Basically, it gives the user the possibility to verify the  weather in his or her city.

Thus, as a traveller, the user is for intance in Atlanta. Thus, he or she wants to visit down town Atlanta. He wants to know how the weather is going to be, so he will not be surprised with the rain. he will enter the city name in search button. And the he will get the information such as the temperature, the wind, and huminity.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project was to use a server side API. The main objective was to retrieve datas from another application. Thus, I had to make a request to retrieve the data from the external API. It runs in the browser. I used the open weather API, to retrieve weather datas for cities. I used local storage to store datas.


## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to point out is JavaScript. It is a pragramming language like Java, PHP, Python, C++. It's considered as the brain in human body. It allows us to implement complex features on web pages, animated graphics, interactive maps and so on.  It's with JavaScript that we have succeded to make this project work.
I also had external API that allowed us to retrieve weather informations for cities.   

## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The big obstacle was how to use retrieve the datas from external API.
